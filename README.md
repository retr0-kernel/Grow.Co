Due to the sheer number of such start-ups, so may not be able to gain traction or even gather any investors due to a variety of issues. Thus, there arises a need for a platform for bridging the communication gap between entrepreneurs and investors that benefits both parties and addresses the said issues. Secondly, many start-ups fail to get the required funding and publicity in their initial phases which eventually results in their shutdown. Especially start-ups in remote areas as well as small start-ups in schools and colleges.
